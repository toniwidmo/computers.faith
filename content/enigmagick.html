<h1>EnigMagick</h1>

<p>On the night of new years day 2013, Agent M was directed by aliens, whilst under the influence of a sacramental entheogen, to write this peice of software for decyphering coded messages received from ultraterrestial entities.</p> 

<p>It is losely based on an older DOS based program called LEXICON, written by another magical trans woman, Tina Coutu, who wrote the software in the 1980s.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/enigmagick/">Download EnigMagick</a> and install on any webserver that supports PHP (possibly, it is really old so I can't guarantee it doesn't use deprecated code).</p>
