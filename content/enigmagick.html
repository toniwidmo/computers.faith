<h1>EnigMagick</h1>

<p>On the night of new years day 2013, Agent M was directed by aliens, 
    whilst under the influence of a sacramental entheogen, to write this 
    peice of software for decyphering coded messages received from 
    ultraterrestial entities.</p> 

<p>It is losely based on an older DOS based program called LEXICON, 
    written by another magical trans woman, Tina Coutu, who wrote the 
    software in the 1980s.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/toniwidmo/enigmagick">Download EnigMagick</a> 
    and install on any webserver that supports PHP.</p>

<p>Agent M added some cool features in 2023, full support for Gematria of Nothing,
    and a REST API so can use other custom apps with EnigMagick in addition to, or
    instead of, using the main web interface. So far Agent M has written two different
    web front ends that consume the API, both of which are demoed on this website,
    <a href="?p=enigmagick/">EnigMagick</a> and <a href="?p=chaoshex/">ChaosHex3</a>,
    both of which are modules for BlockPress (a modular web front end).</p>
    
<h2>EnigMagick BlockPress Module</h2>

<p>The aim of this BlockPress module was to reproduce the functionality with a smoother
    interface with no page reloads. It is still a work in progress but it does return
    matches. It can not function without the API being configured.</p>

<h2>ChaosHex3: The Web version</h2>

<p>ChaosHex is mostly not gematria software, but rather spell casting software that includes
    a trance inducing visualisation to aid in the casting of the spell. It will still work
    without the API, but when the API is configured it will evaluate the numerical value of
    the Statement of Intent and return random matches during the visualisation. It also
    includes a divination feature where you type a question, and it evaluates the numerical
    value of the question and returns 5 random matches as the answer.</p>
