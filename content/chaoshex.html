<h1>ChaosHex</h1>

<p>In the late 1990s, Agent M wrote the first version of ChaosHex in MSDOS batch files and QBASIC. That version has been lost, probably forever unless Agent M ever bothers to get data recovery on that pile of old hard drives she has sitting around.</p>

<h2>ChaosHex2: The Linux version</h2>

<p>In 2013 she wrote a second version, from scratch, using Linux BASH scripting. The code for this version has been preseved on SourceForge.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/chaoshex/">Download Chaoshex2</a> and install on any computer or shell that supports BASH scripting provided you have the correct permissions.</p>

<h2>ChaosHex3: The Web version</h2>

    preseved on GitHub, along with this website.</p>
