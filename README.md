# BlockPress.Me
It is based on an old project of mine called BlockPress.Me, but I am developing a couple of
modules not available in the main BlockPress.Me repo, and which I will never release there.
They should be compatible with any BlockPress.Me based website, although they are pretty
fringe weirdness. These modules are:

## EnigMagick
This is a module to interface with the API of another project of mine called EnigMagick.
It takes a number, or uses gematria to evaluate a number from a word or phrase, then
looks through a text file for other words or phrases that add up to the same number, then
displays those matches in a list.

This module is a work in progress and doesn't yet do any thing.

## ChaosHex
This is a Cyber Magic tool for 'hacking reality'. It was originally an MSDOS program
I wrote in the late 1990s, which has now been lost. I then wrote a BASH version which
can be downloaded and installed on most Linux and other OSes that support a BASH shell.
This is a stub for a third version, which will be web based.
